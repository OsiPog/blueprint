# Hosts

You can configure your project to work with different hosts, which are specific
computers or systems.

> **Note:** Whereas systems refer to operating systems running in conjunction
with a specific architecture, a host refer to specific, single machine (virtual
or physical) that runs Nix or NixOS.
